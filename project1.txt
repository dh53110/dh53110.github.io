<font color = "red"<P> My name is David Han, I know my self introduction usually would come first, but I wanted to let you guys know more about me beforehand. 
I would describe myself as someone who is introverted and someone with a few but valuable friends. I don't take it upon myself to become amiable with strangers, however there are always different situations that allow for such a situation.
Most would not have guessed at first glance, but I am an avid tennis player who loves to take a soak in a pool after a game. Being active is not a problem for me. </P></font>

<P> So why does it matter who <span style= color:green;font-weight:bold">I AM?</span>It doesn't, what matters is who <span style= color: red;font-weight:bold">YOU ARE!</span>
I may like to take walks, do some physical activities, but the real question is <span style= color: red;font-weight:bold">DO YOU?!</span> If this sort of activies pay no interest to yourself, then that's <span style= color:green;font-weight:bold">OK.</span></p>
